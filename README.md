# a web based editor for ZeroTierOne's local.conf 

This doesn't work because typspec emits current json-schema and json-editor supports only old json-schema.

## Motivation
It's easy to make mistakes in your local.conf. Many users aren't familiar with JSON at all.

## Implementation
- [ ] spec a couple common options in https://github.com/microsoft/typespec
- [ ] https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor
- [ ] shove schema into html somehow. prob uhtml. pre-render.
- [ ] json output on page
- [ ] build in an action
- [ ] host on some easy static thing
- [ ] status badge
- [ ] link to site in this readme, on gh sidebar
- [ ] write contributing/development section
